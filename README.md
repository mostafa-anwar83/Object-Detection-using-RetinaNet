# Object Detection using RetinaNet
We will use the RetinaNet deep learning model to carry object detection in images and videos. We will not be training our own model. Instead, we will use a pre-trained model that PyTorch provides. Using this pre-trained deep learning model, we will be able to detect more than 80 classes of objects that are a part of the COCO dataset.
